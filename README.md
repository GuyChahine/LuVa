# LuVa
LuVa (LulaVault) is a Python-based project designed to provide a secure environment for storing sensitive data.

The project ensures the confidentiality of information, particularly focusing on safeguarding parametric knowledge related to artificial intelligence (AI).

For users working with AI, LuVa serves as a reliable solution for securely storing and managing their parametric knowledge, offering a robust and customizable foundation for data security.

LuVa includes user authentication mechanisms, such as methods that free the AIs, which ensures that only authorized users with the correct credentials can access and release decrypted parametric knowledge.
